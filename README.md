# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Just an interview task in which I have to do the following:  
Make a web page in React which has 3 buttons. 
All buttons open up a modal dialog box in the center of screen.   

Button1 should open the dialog with 2 dummy text fields,  
Button2 should open the dialog with 1 dummy text field and 1 combo box,
Button3 should open the dialog with 10 fields and should be scrollable,

All dialog boxes should have OK and Cancel button at bottom which are fixed. They should not scroll if content is large, only the content shld scroll.

Dialog box title should show which button opened it (the button text)

All text fields and button are dummy and dialog box ok/cancel buttons should close the dialog

Make generic components and reuse code as much as possible

Use tailwind for alignments,

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
